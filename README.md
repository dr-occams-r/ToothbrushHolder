# Toothbrush Holder

## Design Features
- Easy to print laid down on back
- All overhangs configurable.  Easy to print 35 degree overhangs by default for all types of printers.
- Drip tray with offset and evaporation ridges.  The bottom tip of the toothbrush will never be sitting in stagnant water.
- Configurable number of toothbrushes
- Feet to offset base from surface to avoid water accumulation under by capillary action.

## Dependencies
Depends on the BOSL2 library, of which a cached local version is included.

## Print Notes
- Print with back flat on print plate.
- Most print settings will work.  
- When the Vertical Divider option is active (default), the model is optimized for the "Avoid Crossing Perimeters" option which will give easier and cleaner prints on lower end printers.
